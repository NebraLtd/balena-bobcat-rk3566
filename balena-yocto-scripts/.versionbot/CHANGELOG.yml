    - subject: "barys: fix removal of equals sign from argval"
      hash: 8855ad4d31b45187e4007763b6bb084e08974807
      body: |
        When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake build,
        keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However, the
        splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence, which
        results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is
        problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with equals
        signs.

        Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

        As per https://jel.ly.fish/a533a6bd-1c98-412c-ae60-8427e3f7b005,
        the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
        the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
        from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

        For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

        tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last meta-balena version

        will be a proper semver.

        * Convert balena_deploy_build_block to balena_build_block, and deploy
          with balena_deploy_block
        * Remove balena_deploy_hostapp and replace with balena_deploy_block
        * Modify balena_deploy_hostos to use balena_deploy_block
        * Modify balena_deploy_block to use release versioning

        By deafult image deployments happen as draft versions, and only become
        final when passing validation.

        When fetching images for blocks, use a given release revision.


        Also, add token autentication to the API calls that miss it so that they work

        with private device types.


        Finally, fix indentation.

        When using the now deprecated release_version field, the API would
        reject deployments for an existing release.

        On the new versioning model, deployments increment a revision field so
        there is no need to check for uniqueness.

        BalenaCloud has now a release versioning feature that deprecates the
        use of release_version.

        Introduce a new balena_lib_release() function that utilises a balena
        contract and the CLI to set the release version.

        The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto cache, which

        made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


        This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

        this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

        Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when two

        builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

        because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

        Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

        Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that mixes

        recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag not to

        stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


        The contracts have now been modified to specify either a `sw.recipe.yocto`

        or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and use

        recipe names to build and package names to install.


        We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

        By default we enable both which is the current dockerd default.

        When running a single docker daemon without the iptables and ipmasq flags,

        containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with the

        outside as no iptables rules are set.

        This commit extends barys so it accepts a list of bitbake arguments
        and/or target images. This will allow the flexibilty needed to build
        blocks with barys as frontend.

      body: >-
        Setting `--supervisor-tag` to enable building for a specific supervisor

        tag sets the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` value. That is the correct variable

        to set according to meta-balena (see at https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/blob/8d5057b45e1965e6c27c03a95d2211ae47842331/meta-balena-common/recipes-containers/resin-supervisor/resin-supervisor.inc#L20 )

        but in the device types' `local.conf.sample` the `TARGET_TAG` variable

        was set, see for example https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/blob/078b0add0345e94f27c15d98256f8c7b61b66761/layers/meta-balena-raspberrypi/conf/samples/local.conf.sample#L45-L46

        and thus barys' setting was not applied.

        Looking at the available recipes, the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` should be set

        and in the device types' `local.conf.example` files should be updated

        to refer to that instead of `TARGET_TAG`.

        With this change this can be implemented in two steps:

        * the current PR updates `SUPERVISOR_TAG` if exists or appends if it doesn't (or the

        update has failed) in local.conf and allows using the relevant barys flag again

        * in other per-device repo PRs then the `local.conf.example` can separately updated,

        to be less misleading, on its own schedule

        We create two groups right now: one for docker and one for the

        user running the script (to avoid any permission issues). The docker group

        is created without specifying the GID so it will take the first available one

        (in container that is 1000). The user GID can be anything from 1000 up.

        If the user has GID 1000 and we first create docker group (this will take 1000)

        and then the user group (1000), we will get an error. Avoid this by creating

        the current user group first and then the docker one.

        arguments while running barys.
