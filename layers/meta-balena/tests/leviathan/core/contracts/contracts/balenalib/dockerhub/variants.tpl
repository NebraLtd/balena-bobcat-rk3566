# [Image Variants][variants]

The `balenalib` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `:<version>` or `:<version>-run`

This is the defacto image. The `run` variant is designed to be a slim and minimal variant with only runtime essentials packaged into it.

## `:<version>-build`

The build variant is a heavier image that includes many of the tools required for building from source. This reduces the number of packages that you will need to manually install in your Dockerfile, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.
